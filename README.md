# Covid-19-Face-Shield
The face Shield

Dreamworks Makerspace has created a design for the face shield, which is an urgent requirement in the nation's fight against COVID19. We have reworked on the design from Makers Asylum and have created a modified version. 

You can use the design file for creating face shields at your place.
