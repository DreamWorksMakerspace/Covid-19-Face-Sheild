# Covid-19-Face-Shield
The face Shield mask


As we are all aware of the widespread Coronavirus and also as it is a respiratory virus, a
great way to fight against it is a Face Shield. Over the last few weeks we have seen a lot of
demand for these masks and also that masks are running out of stock. We have also
designed a Face Shield using laser cutting in order to lend our help in fighting against this
disease.
