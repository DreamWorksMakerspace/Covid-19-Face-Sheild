# Covid-19-Face-Sheild
The face Sheild mask


As we are all aware of the wide spread Corona virus, and also that it is a respiratory virus a
great way to fight against it is a Face Sheild. Over the last few weeks we have seen a lot of
demand for these masks and also that masks are running out of stock. We have also
designed a Face Sheild using laser cutting in order to lend our help in fighting against this
disease.
